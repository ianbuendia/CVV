        <p style="">Hi Love! I just want to say thank you for coming into my life.
        <br> So many things that ran into my mind. Even tho it hurt us both. <br>
        you're still there to support me.<br></p>
        <p>I know things have been tough and I think it is I who should take the blame.<br>
        All I want is for us to still be together, and I know we'll make it through.<br></p>
